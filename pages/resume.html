<h3>PROJECTS</h3>

<h4>CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION</h4>

Analyzed a dataset of over 250,000 credit card transactions to develop a predictive model for detecting fraud, utilizing unsupervised machine learning and predictive modeling techniques.
Conducted preliminary statistical analysis and applied logistic regression to enhance model precision, achieving a false negative rate of less than 2% while maintaining an accuracy of over 90%.
Developed adaptive backend Python code, called from a well-organized and presented Jupyter Notebook, allowing adjustments to accuracy, runtime, and false negative thresholds to meet user interests and needs.
<h4>MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS</h4>
<p>Analyzed datasets comprising program expenditures and annual point-in-time counts of homelessness; standardized data to address bias and enhance model accuracy.
Utilized mixed-effects modeling to account for city-specific variations, such as economic conditions.
Identified “rapid rehousing” and “flexible funds” as the most effective homelessness intervention programs.
Conducted residual analysis and addressed multicollinearity to improve model reliability, removing collinear predictors to refine outcomes.
Produced actionable insights for optimizing resource allocation, contributing to regional strategies for reducing unsheltered homelessness in San Diego County which hold the potential to be extrapolated to other counties.</p>

<h4>THE BURDEN OF PUBLIC WAGES ON SAN DIEGO COUNTY TAXPAYERS</h4>
<p>Implemented iterative web scraping algorithms and natural language processing techniques to ensure data accuracy, including standardizing: names, job titles, and addressing confounding factors such as school enrollment.
Conducted multivariate regression analyses and independent t-tests to explore wage dynamics, revealing a significant correlation between staff turnover and wage increases in police departments and school districts.
Identified a 19.73% wage increase for police officers following a 1% staff reduction and a 7.9% wage increase for teachers switching districts, highlighting the financial burden of turnover on taxpayers.</p>
